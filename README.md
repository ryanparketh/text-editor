# Text Editor

## Description
In this project, I have built a text editor that runs in the browser as a single-page application (SPA) and meets the Progressive Web Application (PWA) criteria. The text editor features data persistence techniques to ensure that the data is not lost even if one of the options is not supported by the browser. Additionally, the application will function offline. I started with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data using idb, a lightweight package that is a wrapper around the IndexedDB API. This package has useful methods for storing and retrieving data and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
